### Description
This repository contains technqiues and solutions to solve various Data Structures and algorithms (DSA) in python

### Table of Contents
* [Recursion](#ecursion)
* [Linked Lists](#linkedlists)

# Recursion
In this [section](), we will cover various ways to utilize recursion to solve dsa questions such as:
* fibonacci numbers
* Tower of Hanoni
* More recursion problems attached [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/recursion-practice-problems-solutions/)
* And leetcode [problems]()

# LinkedLists
In this [section](), we will implement various dsa questions with linked lists such as:
* find the length of a linked list
* get the middle node of a linked list 
* reverse a linkee list
* find the given nth node in a sorted linked lsit
* search for a value in a specific node in a linked list
* insert a node at the beginning of a linked list
* insert a node at the end of a linked list
* insert a node at a given position in a linked list
* Remove duplicates in the linked list
